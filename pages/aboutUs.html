                    <p>Mumei Nanashi. A member of the Council and the Guardian of "Civilization", a concept crafted by mankind.
                        As a living embodiment of the sum of mankind's efforts—the mark that humans have left on the world—she is far removed from her fellow members, as well as other lifeforms. Due to not being created by the Gods, she was free to choose her own appearance, and decided to make herself owl-like, after the bird that symbolizes wisdom.</p>

                            <p>Many years ago, during the Warring Factions era, there were two specially powerful clans,namely the Senju Clan and the Uchiha clan. They had a war that went on for centuries with no end on the foreseeable future, with uncountable losses for both sides. That was, until a man named Hashirama from the Senju clan was blessed with a power above that of his peers, and he decided to use it to put an end to this war. However, it was easier said than done, since both clans had strong grudges against the opposing one. That's when Mumei intervened and helped Hashirama as the Guardian of Civilization. A few years later, the clan leaders, Hashirama and Madara, did a peace treaty, putting an end to the wars. "This is something they could have easily discussed over a cup of coffee", said Mumei, exhausted after the efforts.</p>

                            <p>At some point in time, Mumei was really tired due to her Guardian duties, so she wanted a place to chill and rest, and she found just that on North Vancouver, a peaceful and friendly city with a lot of cultures merging and interacting, making it a perfect place to stablish and rest while keeping her duties on check.</p>

                            <p>One day a few years ago, Mumei was making some coffee on her house, and she remembered her thoughts after the Warring Factions era ended, "This is something they could have easily discussed over a cup of coffee".</p>

                            <p>After thinking about it and discussing it with her fellow council members, she decided to open our shop, a place where you could chill, rest, and talk with whoever you needed to.</p>

                            <p>At the very end, the shop was very small, and she had to work in it herself due to not having employees, but as time passed, the shop made up a good reputation, and grew quite a bit. Making it easier to get employees and a bigger place.</p>
